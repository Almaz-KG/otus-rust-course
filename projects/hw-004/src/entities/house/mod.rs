//! A submodule for storing house related entities
//! It might be useful to store commonly related entities
//! under one single module for external use cases and
//! mainly for documenting

/// An another nested submodule, just because in this home
/// work we're forced to create as much nested modules
/// and entities in their rust files. This module holds
/// only two public structs
pub mod home;

/// This module devoted to the entities related to `Room`
/// It might be somehow useful for end user, but I'm not sure
/// about it.
