//! This is a container for different variety of entities
//! for the OTUS smart-home project.
//!
//! Smart home project is a series of small rust logics
//! aiming to provide the complete smart house, with variety
//! smart controllers and devices.
//!
//! The `entities` sub module contains as name claims the entities
//! for the project use case.
//!
//! Hopefully, in the future home works, a bunch of new submodules
//! will be included here, so this module will not be so lonely
//!
