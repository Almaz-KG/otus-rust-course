## Torrentino

This is a blazingly fast bit torrent client written in pure and ideomatic Rust. Torrentino project
is the part of the [Otus Rust Developer Course](https://otus.ru/lessons/rust-developer/)

The future list of this project will be updated during the course, and in the process of
implementation. It should be a complete product, which allows to end user have a possibility
to download any data from public servers, which support bit-torrent protocol. Many ideas and
inspiration was taken from [How to make your own bittorrent client](https://allenkim67.github
.io/programming/2016/05/04/how-to-make-your-own-bittorrent-client.html#opening-the-torrent-file) guide


### Possible feature list
- CLI client
- desktop application
- web client

### Resources
1. [BitTorrentSpecification](https://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification) - Detailed and very readable unofficial
bittorrent specification
1. [UDP Tracker Protocol for BitTorrent](http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0015.html) - An official specification of
bit torrent protocol. I recommend to read unofficial one first, just because is more understandable from newbies
point of view.
1. [The BitTorrent Protocol](https://www.morehawes.co.uk/old-guides/the-bittorrent-protocol) Another good high level explanation of the BitTorrent protocol
